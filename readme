Simple Example DayZ Local Server Batch File For Use With Windows

This is a simple .bat file that is required to start your local DayZ server when it is installed on your own Windows PC.

Local DayZ Servers are useful for single-player offline gameplay, testing & exploring mods, and improving and practicing your coding skills.

The file is provided in two formats: .bat & .txt , because sometimes your systems will not allow transfer of .bat files. If so, transfer the .txt version, then when it
is in place, change it the name to "st-zb-ch.bat" by opening the file in a text editor and using the "save as" function. Make sure you include the quotation marks.

You'll need to change the set serverLocation line to the location and path to where your local server is installed on your PC.

It will be something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZServer

The start line in the mods section refers to "-mod=@CF;@ZomBerry Admin Tools" so either remove this reference if you don't want to use them, install those mods, or change to your
requirements.

You'll find "DayZ Server" in your Steam Library under "Tools". Install from there, but don't run it from Steam - you double click on this batch file to start the server.

To stop your server, switch to the window with the black background and white text and press space, then close the window, or just close the window with the white background and black text,
and the window  with the black background and white text.
